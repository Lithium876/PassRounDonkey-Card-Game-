# PassRounDonkey (Card Game)
The aim of this card game is to get 4 cards of the same value and show your hand before other players, provided that they also have 4 cards of the same value. The game only use the kings, Queens, Jacks, and Aces from a deck of cards to play. 

# How the game is played
This version of the game is played with only 4 players. For each player's turn, they must give the player after them a card from their hand, this is usually a card that is not of the value they need to win. This continues until one or more players have 4 cards of the same value!. If more than one player have winning hands, then the player who show their hand first wins.

<b>NOTE: A Player can only show their hand after all players have 4 cards in hand. Meaning If a player has a winning hand, that hand should not be shown until all 4 players have 4 cards in hand, i.e after a round has ended. </b>
